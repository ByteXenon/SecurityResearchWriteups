# SecurityResearchWriteups

This repository contains detailed writeups of various exploits, vulnerabilities, and bugs in popular services that I have discovered and disclosed. The purpose of these writeups is to document my findings and share them with the community, in order to help improve the security of these services and educate others about these types of issues.

Each writeup includes a detailed description of the issue, the steps I took to discover it, and any relevant code or screenshots. I also discuss any interactions I had with the service provider regarding the issue, including their response and any steps they took to fix it.

Please note that all of the issues discussed in this repository have been responsibly disclosed to the relevant service providers, and I have obtained their permission before publishing these writeups. I strongly believe in responsible disclosure and the importance of working with service providers to fix these issues, rather than exploiting them for personal gain.

I hope you find these writeups informative and helpful. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to email me.
